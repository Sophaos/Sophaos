# Hi there, I'm Son-Thang ! ðŸ‘‹

## About me

With a degree in software engineering from Ã‰cole Polytechnique de MontrÃ©al, I distinguished myself throughout my university career by completing four integration projects and four internships, each lasting four months. One of these internships led to a part-time job, then to a permanent full-time position. Currently a programmer for a small on-call company, I'm also pursuing my professional development by creating various personal projects.

## Relevant experience

I've worked in both small two-person teams and larger multidisciplinary teams.  
I've gained varied experience working as a front-end developer at Ubisoft, notably on the LiveOps web application linked to the game *Rainbow Six Mobile*, in a government environment using older technologies, in mobile development at nventive for clients such as VCA and Cineplex, and in full-stack development at my last two jobs.
